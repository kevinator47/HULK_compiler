# ü¶ñ HULK Compiler

This project is a compiler for the HULK programming language, developed as part of a third-year Computer Science course in Compiler Construction at university. The compiler is implemented in C and leverages Flex and Bison for lexical and syntactic analysis, and LLVM for code generation.

## Project Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The HULK compiler translates source code written in the HULK language into LLVM IR and/or native executables. The project demonstrates the full compilation pipeline, including lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, semantic analysis, and code generation.

This project is part of the curriculum for the "Compilaci√≥n" (Compiler Construction) course, aiming to provide hands-on experience in building a working compiler from scratch.

## Project Structure üèõÔ∏è

- **build/**  
  Contains build artifacts, object files, and the final compiler executable.

- **src/**  
  Main source code for the compiler.
  - **main.c**: Entry point for the compiler.
  - **backend/**: Code generation logic.
    - **codegen/**: General code generation.
    - **llvm/**: LLVM-specific code generation.
  - **frontend/**: Frontend logic.
    - **ast/**: Abstract Syntax Tree node definitions and logic.
    - **hulk_type/**: Type system and type descriptors.
    - **scope/**: Symbol tables and scope management.
    - **semantic_check/**: Semantic analysis and type checking.
    - **parser/**: Parser definitions (Bison).
    - **lexer/**: Lexer definitions (Flex).

- **test/**  
  Test cases for the compiler, organized by feature (basic, conditional, functions, etc.).

- **grammars/**  
  Documentation for the HULK grammar.
